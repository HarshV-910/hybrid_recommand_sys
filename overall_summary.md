# Music Recommendation System: Overall Flow Summary

This document outlines the complete pipeline for the hybrid music recommendation system, combining content-based and collaborative filtering approaches. It explains the data flow, key datasets, transformations, and how recommendations are generated, including solutions to alignment and scaling issues.

## 1. Data Overview

### Raw Datasets
- **`user_data` (User Listening History)**:
  - Source: `data/raw/User_Listening_History.csv`
  - Shape: ~9.7 million rows × 3 columns (`user_id`, `track_id`, `playcount`)
  - Description: Records user interactions with songs, including play counts. Contains ~30k unique `track_id`s (songs that have been listened to by users).
  - Note: Sparse data (many users haven't listened to many songs), which is why cosine similarity is used for collaborative filtering.

- **`songs_data` (Music Info)**:
  - Source: `data/raw/Music_Info.csv`
  - Shape: ~50k rows × 21 columns (includes `track_id`, `name`, `artist`, `spotify_preview_url`, `tags`, `genre`, audio features like `danceability`, `energy`, etc.)
  - Description: Metadata and features for all songs in the catalog. Includes ~50k unique songs.

### Key Insight
- Only ~30k songs from `songs_data` have user interaction data in `user_data`. The rest (~20k) have no listening history, so they're excluded from collaborative filtering.

## 2. Content-Based Recommender

### Step 1: Data Cleaning (`clean_music_data`)
- **Input**: `songs_data` (~50k rows)
- **Process**:
  - Drop duplicates and null values.
  - Drop unique columns like `track_id`, `spotify_id`, `name`, `spotify_preview_url`, and `genre` (these can't be used for cosine similarity as they're identifiers or non-numeric).
  - Fill nulls in `tags` with 'no_tag'.
  - Convert `artist` to lowercase.
  - Convert `year` to category for encoding.
- **Output**: `df_cleaned` (~50k rows × cleaned columns, e.g., `artist`, `tags`, `year`, audio features).
- **Saved As**: `data/processed/df_cleaned.csv`

### Step 2: Data Transformation (`transformed_data`)
- **Input**: `df_cleaned`
- **Process**:
  - **Vectorization & Scaling**: Use `ColumnTransformer` to convert strings to numerical vectors:
    - `CountEncoder` (frequency encoding) on `year`.
    - `OneHotEncoder` on `artist`, `time_signature`, `key`.
    - `TfidfVectorizer` (TF-IDF) on `tags` (text column, with stop words removed, max_features from params.yaml).
    - `StandardScaler` on `duration_ms`, `loudness`, `tempo`.
    - `MinMaxScaler` on `danceability`, `energy`, `speechiness`, `acousticness`, `instrumentalness`, `liveness`, `valence`.
  - This creates dense numerical vectors for each song.
- **Output**: `transformed_data` (sparse CSR matrix, shape: 50k rows × ~8431 features).
- **Saved As**: `data/processed/df_transformed.npz` (sparse matrix) + `models/transformer.joblib` (fitted transformer).

### Step 3: Recommendation Generation
- **Input**: `song_name` (e.g., "Mr. Brightside")
- **Process**:
  - Find the song's row in `songs_data` by `name`.
  - Extract its vector from `transformed_data`.
  - Compute cosine similarity between this vector and all other vectors in `transformed_data` (dense matrix, so similarities are high, near 1.0).
  - Sort similarities in descending order using `np.argsort`.
  - Select top-k indices and retrieve corresponding songs from `songs_data`.
- **Output**: List of recommended songs with `name`, `artist`, `spotify_preview_url`.
- **Key Params**: `k` (number of recommendations, e.g., 10).

## 3. Collaborative-Based Recommender

### Step 1: Interaction Matrix Creation
- **Input**: `user_data` (~9.7M rows)
- **Process**:
  - Use Dask for handling large data (~60GB potential dense matrix).
  - Encode `user_id` and `track_id` to categorical codes (to handle large numbers of users).
  - Create sparse CSR matrix: rows = `track_id` (30k unique), columns = `user_id` (~970k unique), values = aggregated `playcount`.
  - Divide data into 9 chunks for processing.
- **Output**: `interaction_matrix` (sparse CSR matrix, shape: 30k tracks × 970k users).
- **Saved As**: `data/processed/interaction_matrix.npz` + `models/track_ids.npy` (array of 30k track_ids in encoded order).

### Step 2: Song Filtering (`filtered_songs_data`)
- **Input**: `songs_data` (~50k rows) + `track_ids` (30k from interaction matrix)
- **Process**: Filter `songs_data` to only include songs present in `track_ids` (i.e., songs with user interactions).
- **Output**: `filtered_songs_data` (~30k rows × 21 columns, same structure as `songs_data`).
- **Saved As**: `data/processed/collab_filtered.csv`

### Step 3: Recommendation Generation
- **Input**: `song_name`, `artist_name` (e.g., "Mr. Brightside" by "The Killers")
- **Process**:
  - Find the song's `track_id` in `filtered_songs_data`.
  - Get its encoded index in `track_ids` (position in interaction matrix).
  - Extract the song's vector from `interaction_matrix` (sparse, so similarities are low).
  - Compute cosine similarity between this vector and all other vectors in `interaction_matrix`.
  - Sort similarities in descending order.
  - Map back to original `track_id`s and retrieve songs from `filtered_songs_data`.
- **Output**: List of recommended songs with `name`, `artist`, `spotify_preview_url`.
- **Key Params**: `k` (number of recommendations).

## 4. Hybrid Recommender

### Overview
- Combines content-based and collaborative scores: `final_score = w1 * s1 + w2 * s2`, where `w1 + w2 = 1` (e.g., `w1=0.5`, `w2=0.5`).
- **Input**: `song_name`, `artist_name`, `k` (recommendations).
- **Challenge**: Content scores are over 50k songs, collaborative over 30k → shape mismatch (50k vs. 30k).

### Step 1: Score Computation
- **Content Scores (`s1`)**: Compute over full `songs_data` and `transformed_data` (50k songs).
- **Collaborative Scores (`s2`)**: Compute over `filtered_songs_data`, `track_ids`, and `interaction_matrix` (30k songs).

### Step 2: Alignment (Solving Problem 1)
- **Issue**: `s1` is sorted by original `songs_data` index; `s2` is sorted by lexical (alphabetical) `track_id` order from Dask encoding.
- **Solution**: Align `s1` to the `track_ids` order:
  - Create a mapping from `track_id` to index in `songs_data`.
  - Reindex `s1` to match `track_ids` sequence.
  - Now both `s1` and `s2` are aligned on the same 30k songs.

### Step 3: Normalization (Solving Problem 2)
- **Issue**: Content similarities are high (dense matrix); collaborative are low (sparse matrix).
- **Solution**: Apply min-max normalization to both `s1` and `s2` before combining:
  - `normalized_s = (s - min(s)) / (max(s) - min(s))` if range > 0, else all zeros.

### Step 4: Combination and Recommendation
- Compute `final_scores = w1 * normalized_s1 + w2 * normalized_s2`.
- Sort `final_scores` descending, select top-k indices.
- Map indices to `track_id`s, retrieve from `filtered_songs_data` (to preserve ranking).
- **Output**: List of recommended songs with `name`, `artist`, `spotify_preview_url`.

### Key Params
- `weight_content` (w1, e.g., 0.5)
- `weight_collaborative` (w2, e.g., 0.5)
- `k` (recommendations)

## 5. Additional Details
- **Cosine Similarity**: Used throughout due to sparse data (efficient for high-dimensional vectors).
- **Dask Usage**: For large `user_data` processing to avoid memory issues.
- **Sparse Matrices**: `transformed_data` and `interaction_matrix` are saved as `.npz` for efficiency.
- **Error Handling**: Hybrid checks for shape mismatches, missing track_ids, and duplicate track_ids.
- **Streamlit App**: Loads all datasets and provides UI for selecting recommendation type.

This flow ensures scalable, accurate recommendations by leveraging both song features and user behavior.

## 6. Additional Insights and Optimizations

### Recommendation Strategies
- **Dynamic Recommendations**: To make suggestions more dynamic and based on what others like, we increase the collaborative weight (focus more on user behavior patterns).
- **Personalized Recommendations**: For more personalized results based on the song's features, we increase the content weight (focus more on the music's characteristics).

### Handling Song Data
- We have information for about 50,000 songs in total. However, only 30,000 of these have user listening data. This means:
  - The 30,000 songs with user data can use all types of recommendations (content-based, collaborative, and hybrid).
  - The remaining 20,000 songs (without user data) can only use content-based recommendations, as there's no collaborative information available.

### User-Based Approach
- **New Users**: Since they don't have listening history, we use content-based recommendations to suggest songs similar to their selected one.
- **Existing Users**: For users with past listening data, we use the hybrid approach to combine both content and collaborative methods for better results.

### Streamlit Performance
- Streamlit reruns the entire script every time a user changes an option (like selecting a song or clicking a button), which can be slow if loading large datasets each time.
- To fix this, we load and store the datasets only once during the first run, using caching to keep them in memory for faster access.

### Evaluation Metrics
- Common metrics for evaluating recommendation systems are precision (how many recommended items are relevant) and recall (how many relevant items are recommended).
- However, we don't use these here because we don't have labeled data (ground truth about what users actually like or dislike). Instead, we rely on the system's logic and user feedback for improvements.

CI : (dvc pipeline -> github action runner -> test)
s3.bucket for dvc remote, dvc push, 
commands:{
  aws configure
  dvc remote add -d myremote s3://hybrid-recsys-remote-bkt
  dvc push
  git add/commit/push
}

to create requirements.txt without version coflict then first create requirements.in and add there basic names of lib and now run this(takes time):{
  pip install pip-tools
  touch requirements.in -> add libraries names in this file
  pip-compile requirements.in
  pip install -r requirements.txt
}

CD :
all code -> docker img -> push on AWS ECR
to create docker image: {
  docker build -t hybrid_sys:test . <!-- to build img -->
  docker run --name hybrid_sys -d -p 8000:8000 hybrid_sys:test <!--to run img-->

  docker ps <!-- to check running container -->
  docker stop <container_id> <!-- to Stop a running container ( -->
  docker image -a <!-- to show all images -->
  docker rmi <img_id> <!-- to Delete an image -->
}

check streamlit app on localhost:8000
then create ECR at AWS like "hybrid_sys_ecr"
then open that ecr and use push commands and use in ci.yaml file
now use commands of ecr for checking{
  first command: for login same 
  last command: of push but change push->pull
  then copy name of img by: docker image ls -a
  then docker run command given above: docker run --name hybrid_sys_ecr -d -p 8000:8000 <copied_name with tag latest>
  now check localhost:8000 for streamlit app
}


now for this pulling we create ec2 instance on AWS:
- create role: (create role with EC2 permissions,policy:AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess,name:ec2_ecr_role,)
- launch EC2: (create instance,name:ec2_ecr_instance,server:ubantu,keypair,security_grp:add all TCP,advance:add role:ec2_ecr_role)
- install docker on it:{
  sudo apt-get update -y
  sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
  sudo systemctl start docker
  sudo systemctl enable docker
  sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
}
- install awscli:{
  sudo apt-get install -y unzip curl
  curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "/home/ubuntu/awscliv2.zip"
  unzip -o /home/ubuntu/awscliv2.zip -d /home/ubuntu/
  sudo /home/ubuntu/aws/install

  rm -rf /home/ubuntu/awscliv2.zip /home/ubuntu/aws
  sudo systemctl status docker
  newgrp docker
  sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
  sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
  sudo mkswap /swapfile
  sudo swapon /swapfile
}

- authenticate by aws configure:{
  aws configure
}

- connect docker with ecr & pull & run: {
  aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-southeast-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 252312374343.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com

  docker pull 252312374343.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/hybrid_sys_ecr:latest

  docker run --name hybrid_sys_ecr -d -p 8000:8000 252312374343.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/hybrid_sys_ecr:latest
}

problem: streamlit not compatible with EC2, songs preview is https and we run on http,  


pull docker img -> run app on single EC2(docker install,pull img from ECR, container runn, live app)
