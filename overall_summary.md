# Music Recommendation System: Overall Flow Summary

This document outlines the complete pipeline for the hybrid music recommendation system, combining content-based and collaborative filtering approaches. It explains the data flow, key datasets, transformations, and how recommendations are generated, including solutions to alignment and scaling issues.

## 1. Data Overview

### Raw Datasets
- **`user_data` (User Listening History)**:
  - Source: `data/raw/User_Listening_History.csv`
  - Shape: ~9.7 million rows × 3 columns (`user_id`, `track_id`, `playcount`)
  - Description: Records user interactions with songs, including play counts. Contains ~30k unique `track_id`s (songs that have been listened to by users).
  - Note: Sparse data (many users haven't listened to many songs), which is why cosine similarity is used for collaborative filtering.

- **`songs_data` (Music Info)**:
  - Source: `data/raw/Music_Info.csv`
  - Shape: ~50k rows × 21 columns (includes `track_id`, `name`, `artist`, `spotify_preview_url`, `tags`, `genre`, audio features like `danceability`, `energy`, etc.)
  - Description: Metadata and features for all songs in the catalog. Includes ~50k unique songs.

### Key Insight
- Only ~30k songs from `songs_data` have user interaction data in `user_data`. The rest (~20k) have no listening history, so they're excluded from collaborative filtering.

## 2. Content-Based Recommender

### Step 1: Data Cleaning (`clean_music_data`)
- **Input**: `songs_data` (~50k rows)
- **Process**:
  - Drop duplicates and null values.
  - Drop unique columns like `track_id`, `spotify_id`, `name`, `spotify_preview_url`, and `genre` (these can't be used for cosine similarity as they're identifiers or non-numeric).
  - Fill nulls in `tags` with 'no_tag'.
  - Convert `artist` to lowercase.
  - Convert `year` to category for encoding.
- **Output**: `df_cleaned` (~50k rows × cleaned columns, e.g., `artist`, `tags`, `year`, audio features).
- **Saved As**: `data/processed/df_cleaned.csv`

### Step 2: Data Transformation (`transformed_data`)
- **Input**: `df_cleaned`
- **Process**:
  - **Vectorization & Scaling**: Use `ColumnTransformer` to convert strings to numerical vectors:
    - `CountEncoder` (frequency encoding) on `year`.
    - `OneHotEncoder` on `artist`, `time_signature`, `key`.
    - `TfidfVectorizer` (TF-IDF) on `tags` (text column, with stop words removed, max_features from params.yaml).
    - `StandardScaler` on `duration_ms`, `loudness`, `tempo`.
    - `MinMaxScaler` on `danceability`, `energy`, `speechiness`, `acousticness`, `instrumentalness`, `liveness`, `valence`.
  - This creates dense numerical vectors for each song.
- **Output**: `transformed_data` (sparse CSR matrix, shape: 50k rows × ~8431 features).
- **Saved As**: `data/processed/df_transformed.npz` (sparse matrix) + `models/transformer.joblib` (fitted transformer).

### Step 3: Recommendation Generation
- **Input**: `song_name` (e.g., "Mr. Brightside")
- **Process**:
  - Find the song's row in `songs_data` by `name`.
  - Extract its vector from `transformed_data`.
  - Compute cosine similarity between this vector and all other vectors in `transformed_data` (dense matrix, so similarities are high, near 1.0).
  - Sort similarities in descending order using `np.argsort`.
  - Select top-k indices and retrieve corresponding songs from `songs_data`.
- **Output**: List of recommended songs with `name`, `artist`, `spotify_preview_url`.
- **Key Params**: `k` (number of recommendations, e.g., 10).

## 3. Collaborative-Based Recommender

### Step 1: Interaction Matrix Creation
- **Input**: `user_data` (~9.7M rows)
- **Process**:
  - Use Dask for handling large data (~60GB potential dense matrix).
  - Encode `user_id` and `track_id` to categorical codes (to handle large numbers of users).
  - Create sparse CSR matrix: rows = `track_id` (30k unique), columns = `user_id` (~970k unique), values = aggregated `playcount`.
  - Divide data into 9 chunks for processing.
- **Output**: `interaction_matrix` (sparse CSR matrix, shape: 30k tracks × 970k users).
- **Saved As**: `data/processed/interaction_matrix.npz` + `models/track_ids.npy` (array of 30k track_ids in encoded order).

### Step 2: Song Filtering (`filtered_songs_data`)
- **Input**: `songs_data` (~50k rows) + `track_ids` (30k from interaction matrix)
- **Process**: Filter `songs_data` to only include songs present in `track_ids` (i.e., songs with user interactions).
- **Output**: `filtered_songs_data` (~30k rows × 21 columns, same structure as `songs_data`).
- **Saved As**: `data/processed/collab_filtered.csv`

### Step 3: Recommendation Generation
- **Input**: `song_name`, `artist_name` (e.g., "Mr. Brightside" by "The Killers")
- **Process**:
  - Find the song's `track_id` in `filtered_songs_data`.
  - Get its encoded index in `track_ids` (position in interaction matrix).
  - Extract the song's vector from `interaction_matrix` (sparse, so similarities are low).
  - Compute cosine similarity between this vector and all other vectors in `interaction_matrix`.
  - Sort similarities in descending order.
  - Map back to original `track_id`s and retrieve songs from `filtered_songs_data`.
- **Output**: List of recommended songs with `name`, `artist`, `spotify_preview_url`.
- **Key Params**: `k` (number of recommendations).

## 4. Hybrid Recommender

### Overview
- Combines content-based and collaborative scores: `final_score = w1 * s1 + w2 * s2`, where `w1 + w2 = 1` (e.g., `w1=0.5`, `w2=0.5`).
- **Input**: `song_name`, `artist_name`, `k` (recommendations).
- **Challenge**: Content scores are over 50k songs, collaborative over 30k → shape mismatch (50k vs. 30k).

### Step 1: Score Computation
- **Content Scores (`s1`)**: Compute over full `songs_data` and `transformed_data` (50k songs).
- **Collaborative Scores (`s2`)**: Compute over `filtered_songs_data`, `track_ids`, and `interaction_matrix` (30k songs).

### Step 2: Alignment (Solving Problem 1)
- **Issue**: `s1` is sorted by original `songs_data` index; `s2` is sorted by lexical (alphabetical) `track_id` order from Dask encoding.
- **Solution**: Align `s1` to the `track_ids` order:
  - Create a mapping from `track_id` to index in `songs_data`.
  - Reindex `s1` to match `track_ids` sequence.
  - Now both `s1` and `s2` are aligned on the same 30k songs.

### Step 3: Normalization (Solving Problem 2)
- **Issue**: Content similarities are high (dense matrix); collaborative are low (sparse matrix).
- **Solution**: Apply min-max normalization to both `s1` and `s2` before combining:
  - `normalized_s = (s - min(s)) / (max(s) - min(s))` if range > 0, else all zeros.

### Step 4: Combination and Recommendation
- Compute `final_scores = w1 * normalized_s1 + w2 * normalized_s2`.
- Sort `final_scores` descending, select top-k indices.
- Map indices to `track_id`s, retrieve from `filtered_songs_data` (to preserve ranking).
- **Output**: List of recommended songs with `name`, `artist`, `spotify_preview_url`.

### Key Params
- `weight_content` (w1, e.g., 0.5)
- `weight_collaborative` (w2, e.g., 0.5)
- `k` (recommendations)

## 5. Additional Details
- **Cosine Similarity**: Used throughout due to sparse data (efficient for high-dimensional vectors).
- **Dask Usage**: For large `user_data` processing to avoid memory issues.
- **Sparse Matrices**: `transformed_data` and `interaction_matrix` are saved as `.npz` for efficiency.
- **Error Handling**: Hybrid checks for shape mismatches, missing track_ids, and duplicate track_ids.
- **Streamlit App**: Loads all datasets and provides UI for selecting recommendation type.

This flow ensures scalable, accurate recommendations by leveraging both song features and user behavior.

dynamic -> increase collab weight
personalized -> increase content weight

we have data about 50k songs and with user data we have just 30k songs. so we will also used 20k songs by 30k -> all type of recommendations and 20k -> content based only

for new user -> content based
for old user -> hybrid

streamlit run every time whole script when it get change in option like button. so it takes too much time to load dataset. -> we store dataset one time during first time loading.

metrics for evaluation: precision & recall but here we not using becausing we not have labelled data.
